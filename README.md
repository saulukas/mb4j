Mustache Bricks for Java
========================

Under construction... early stage...


* brick = model = view, so just take care of brick containing other
  bricks and you will have view consisting of other views.

```java
   public class Ohoho {
   }
```

```mustache
   Hello, {{name}}
```

* rendering bricks, not templates
